Web Technology 2

Hi guys

This is a project which I did as a part of my Advanced Web Technology course using Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrapn (MD Bootstrap) and HTML. 
It makes use of patterns like Periodic Refresh, Multistage Download, Submission Throttle(search box) and Predictive fetch(scroll down the page and see how new content gets added dynamically)

I have also used Node-JS for implementing video streaming. Only when video is viewed more content is dynamically fetched. See folder called streaming

How to run ?
0. Download the MDB (MD Bootstap files along with Bootstrap and Jquery) and place it in the folder called Video
1. Start Apache
2. Open video.html and explore !!!
