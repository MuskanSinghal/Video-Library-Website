Web Technology 2

Hi guys

This is a project which I did as a part of my Advanced Web Technology course using Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap and HTML. 
It makes use of patterns like Periodic Refresh, Multistage Download, Submission Throttle(search box) and Predictive fetch(scroll down the page and see how new content gets added dynamically)

How to run ?
1. Start Apache
2. Open video.html and explore !!!
